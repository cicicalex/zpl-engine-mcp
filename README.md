# ZPL Engine MCP Server

Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for the **Zero Point Logic Engine** — a post-binary stability and neutrality analysis system.

Connects any MCP-compatible AI client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) to the ZPL Engine API for real-time bias detection, stability scoring, and neutrality analysis across multiple domains.

**69 tools** (65 unique + 4 backwards-compat aliases) across 11 categories: Core, Finance, Gaming, AI/ML, Security, Crypto, Certification, Advanced, Universal, Meta, and AI Eval.

## Highlights of the 4.x line

For what changed in the release you are installing, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

Two months of incremental work consolidated. **21 bugs fixed**, **290 tests** (241 unit + 49 live MCP integration), **Windows + Linux verified**. Backwards compatible — legacy `zpl_u_<48hex>` keys still work, all 69 tools keep the same input shape.

### New commands
- **`npx zpl-engine-mcp setup`** — now memory-aware. Detects existing config and offers keep / re-setup / patch-only instead of forcing a fresh login. `--force` bypasses.
- **`npx zpl-engine-mcp whoami`** — shows which account this install is logged into.
- **`npx zpl-engine-mcp repair`** — wipes local config + removes the entry from each MCP client config (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf). Preserves unrelated entries. `--yes` skips confirmation.
- **`npx zpl-engine-mcp --help`** / `--version` — POSIX-standard usage and version flags.
- **`zpl_diagnose` MCP tool** — full health report (config + key + engine + auth) for issue reports.

### Critical fixes
- **API key regex** now accepts wizard-issued keys with type prefixes (`zpl_u_mcp_`, `zpl_u_cli_`, `zpl_u_default_`). Pre-4.0 the wizard install always failed silently.
- **Cloudflare HTML responses explained** — actionable error messages with cf-ray ID instead of generic 403.
- **Smoke test at end of setup** — catches replication lag between wizard approval and engine acceptance.
- **Secret sanitizer in history** — no longer leaks wizard-prefixed ZPL keys or full Anthropic `sk-ant-*` tokens (regex was truncating at first hyphen).
- **Safety bounds on numeric env vars** — `ZPL_RATE_LIMIT` clamped to [1, 600], `ZPL_MAX_RETRIES` to [0, 5].

### Tool fixes
- `zpl_simulate` 0/0 result on positive inputs (switched to distributionBias + identical-input short-circuit).
- `zpl_liquidity` table/verdict misalignment (verdict now cites per-pool counts).
- `zpl_quota` plan auto-detection from config.toml (env > config > "free").
- `zpl_quota` + `zpl_alert` token estimate accuracy — 22 tools now persist real `tokens_used` instead of hardcoded heuristic.
- `zpl_teach` snippet referenced never-published `@zeropointlogic/engine-mcp` package name.
- Duplicate Claude Desktop entries auto-deduplicated on `setup`.
- `LANGUAGE` dead-code env var removed.

See [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) for the complete list with rationales.

## What's new in v3.7.0

- **Setup wizard auto-configures Cursor and Windsurf, not just Claude Desktop.** Each run patches `claude_desktop_config.json`, `~/.cursor/mcp.json`, and `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` in a single pass. Clients that aren't installed are skipped silently; each patch is isolated so one missing client never blocks the others. Empty pre-existing config files (common for Cursor's stub `{"mcpServers":{}}`) are now handled correctly.

## What's new in v3.6.1

- **Free plan quota corrected** — all docs/copy now show **5,000 tokens/month** (was erroneously "500 tokens / ~14 days" in early migration draft). Engine-side was already 5,000; this release just syncs the MCP. See [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md).

## What's new in v3.6.0

- **`npx zpl-engine-mcp setup`** — one-command device-flow wizard: opens browser, authenticates with your ZPL account, creates a per-machine API key, and auto-patches `claude_desktop_config.json`. No more copy-paste.
- **User-key only** — `ZPL_SERVICE_KEY` fallback removed. MCP requires a `zpl_u_...` user key so plan limits apply per account.

## What's new in v3.4.3

- **Local dev fix** — with `ZPL_ENGINE_ALLOW_INSECURE_LOCAL=1`, `localhost` / `127.0.0.1` / `::1` are accepted as engine hostnames (not only production). Use with `http://127.0.0.1:PORT` for a local engine.
- **Version from `package.json`** — MCP `version` field, update check, and report footers no longer hardcode semver strings.
- **`npm test`** — regression tests for engine URL validation (`npm run build && node --test test/engine-url.test.mjs`).

## What's new in v3.4.2

- **Engine URL hardening** — default allowlist is `engine.zeropointlogic.io` only. Self-hosted engines: set `ZPL_ENGINE_HOST_ALLOWLIST=your.hostname`. Local HTTP: `ZPL_ENGINE_ALLOW_INSECURE_LOCAL=1` with `http://127.0.0.1` only. Optional `ZPL_ENGINE_DISABLE_URL_GUARD=1` disables hostname checks (not recommended). All engine `fetch` calls use `redirect: "error"` so redirects cannot carry your Bearer token to a new origin.

## What's new in v3.4.1

- **v3.4.1** — Bug fixes: fixed `zpl_consistency_test` bias inversion (inconsistent responses now correctly lower AIN), session-budget double-counting on Claude eval tools (upfront reservation instead of post-increment), `zpl_alert` budget calc that silently always said "OK" (now uses the same estimate as `zpl_quota`), `zpl_validate_input` stack overflow on very large arrays (reduce loop instead of `Math.min(...values)`), version-check cache ignoring its own 24h window (fixed filename instead of PID-suffixed), stale version strings in `zpl_account`/`zpl_report` output. Store now honours `ZPL_STORE_PATH` (documented) in addition to legacy `ZPL_STORE_DIR`. CSV export now escapes embedded commas/quotes. API key format is validated client-side (fail-fast on obvious mis-paste, prevents accidentally leaking unrelated secrets in the Authorization header). Removed an internal engine-method reference from `zpl_check_response` output. Core `zpl_sweep` and `zpl_analyze` now honour the per-minute rate limiter.
- **v3.4.0** — 8 new AI Eval tools (`zpl_consistency_test`, `zpl_sycophancy_score`, `zpl_refusal_balance`, `zpl_language_equity`, `zpl_persona_drift`, `zpl_safety_boundary`, `zpl_hallucination_consistency`, `zpl_emotional_stability`) that run prompts through Claude and score response distributions with the ZPL engine. Requires a separate `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var. Session budget cap of 100 Claude calls per process to prevent accidental spend. Multilingual propaganda-detection update for `zpl_news_bias` / `zpl_review_bias`: EN + RO + FR + DE + ES + IT keyword lists with a symmetric uniformity penalty (100% positive-only OR 100% negative-only texts trigger the same bonus).
- **v3.3.0** — Added 4 clearer "balance"-prefixed aliases: `zpl_balance_check` (= `zpl_decide`), `zpl_balance_compare` (= `zpl_versus`), `zpl_balance_pair` (= `zpl_compare`), `zpl_balance_rank` (= `zpl_rank`). Both old and new names work; old names get a DEPRECATED note in their description. Existing users keep working without changes.
- **v3.2.0** — 4 new tools: `zpl_about` (project info, no auth), `zpl_quota` (remaining tokens), `zpl_score_only` (minimal JSON for CI/CD), `zpl_validate_input` (free validation). Auto-update check, friendlier signup message, hard disclaimers on hypothetical/bias tools, RNG sample-size warnings, and bias tools re-framed as "language balance" instead of "fake/biased".
- **v3.1.0** — Added `ZPL_MODE` env var (`pure` | `coach`). Pure mode hides AIN scores from the AI on text-evaluation tools (`zpl_check_response`, `zpl_news_bias`, `zpl_review_bias`) to prevent reactivity bias / observer effect.
- **v3.0.0 (BREAKING)** — Removed 5 tools that created false-authority risk: `zpl_ask`, `zpl_certify`, `zpl_certificate`, `zpl_predict`, `zpl_auto_certify`. AIN is a STABILITY measurement only — never a prediction or recommendation.

## Setup (free, 15 seconds)

Run this in your terminal — it authenticates you, creates an API key, and
writes your Claude Desktop config for you:

```bash
npx zpl-engine-mcp@latest setup
```

The wizard will:
1. Open your browser to approve the CLI (sign up if you don't have an account — free, **5,000 tokens/month**, no credit card)
2. Save the key to `~/.zpl/config.toml` (chmod 600)
3. Patch the MCP config of every supported client that's installed:
   - **Claude Desktop** — `claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Cursor** — `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
   - **Windsurf** — `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`
4. Print which clients were configured and which to restart.

That's it. Clients that aren't installed are skipped silently. If you're
using a client we don't auto-detect (Claude Code, VS Code, Zed, ...), the
wizard prints the exact JSON snippet to paste into that client's MCP
config.

<details>
<summary><strong>Manual setup (advanced)</strong></summary>

If you can't run the wizard (air-gapped install, policy restriction, etc.):

1. Sign up at [zeropointlogic.io/auth/register](https://zeropointlogic.io/auth/register) — free, 5,000 tokens/month, no credit card.
2. Copy your `zpl_u_...` key from [/dashboard](https://zeropointlogic.io/dashboard).
3. Add to your Claude Desktop config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zpl-engine": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "zpl-engine-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "ZPL_API_KEY": "zpl_u_YOUR_KEY_HERE",
        "ZPL_MODE": "pure"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

4. Restart Claude Desktop.

## What is ZPL Engine?

The ZPL Engine computes the **AIN (AI Neutrality Index)** — a mathematical measure of how stable or biased a system is. It works across:

- **Finance** — market stability, portfolio bias, risk concentration, forex pairs, fear & greed
- **Gaming** — economy balance, loot fairness, matchmaking, gacha audit, PvP balance
- **AI/ML** — model fairness, prediction bias, dataset balance, prompt testing, benchmarks
- **Security** — vulnerability distribution, risk matrix, compliance scoring
- **Crypto** — whale concentration, DeFi risk, liquidity analysis, tokenomics
- **Certification** — language-balance check on text, debate balance, news balance, review authenticity
- **Universal** — quick decisions, structured comparison, AIN ranking, response balance check

One engine, multiple domains. The engine doesn't know what your data represents — domain "lenses" translate your specific data into the universal mathematical framework.

### Reading the numbers

- **`ain`** — returned by the engine on a **0.0 – 1.0** scale with **6 decimals**. Human-readable tool output shows it on a 0 – 100 scale **with its decimals kept** (`93.24/100`), never rounded to a whole number. `zpl_score_only` returns the raw engine value untouched.
- **`ain_status`** — quality of the equilibrium: `CERTIFIED_NEUTRAL`, `HIGHLY_NEUTRAL`, `NEUTRAL`, `MODERATE_BIAS`, `SIGNIFICANT_BIAS`, `HIGH_BIAS`.
- **`status`** — a **different** field: the stability regime, `STABLE`, `ACTIVE`, `INHIBITED_HIGH`, `INHIBITED_LOW`. There is no plain `INHIBITED` value. Sweep steps carry `status`, not `ain_status`.

## Modes (ZPL_MODE)

ZPL Engine MCP supports two modes for how text-evaluation results are returned:

| Mode | Behavior | When to use |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `pure` (default) | AIN score is **hidden from the AI** on `zpl_check_response`, `zpl_news_bias`, `zpl_review_bias`. The AI gets a verdict category only; the user sees the numeric score separately. | Default for most users. Prevents the **observer effect** — once the AI knows the numeric score, its subsequent output can drift toward it, contaminating downstream analysis. |
| `coach` | AIN score is **exposed to the AI** on all tools. | When you explicitly want the AI to reason *about* the score (e.g. teaching mode, debugging, writing articles about balance scores). |

**Why this matters:** stability scoring only works if the measurement doesn't change the thing it measures. If an AI sees "AIN = 42" and then writes the next paragraph, its language naturally drifts to justify the score. Pure mode breaks that feedback loop.

Set via env: `"ZPL_MODE": "pure"` or `"ZPL_MODE": "coach"`.

## Installation

## Tool Categories (69 tools)

<!--
  AUDIT 2026-08-01 — what was wrong here.

  This line read "Unique tool names: 63. With 4 backwards-compat aliases
  (`zpl_balance_*` pairs) the registered total is 67." Both halves were stale.
  src/tool-count.ts is the single declaration (69 registered, 4 aliases, 65
  unique) and test/tool-count.test.mjs re-counts every `server.tool(...)` call
  in src/ against it, so 69/65 is measured, not typed. The heading one line
  above already said 69 — the file contradicted itself across two adjacent
  lines.

  The table underneath was the source of the 67: its rows summed to 67 because
  Core was missing `zpl_matrix` (added in 4.3.0) and Meta was missing
  `zpl_diagnose` — both registered, and both already advertised higher up in
  this same README. Rows corrected to 10 and 9; the eleven rows now sum to 69.

  Why it survived the guard: tool-count.test.mjs scans published surfaces for
  four shapes — `**<n> tools**`, `<n> tools across`, `Tool Categories (<n>
  tools)` and `<n> unique`. "Unique tool names: 63" puts the number after the
  word, and "the registered total is 67" matches nothing at all, so the guard
  read straight past both. The replacement is deliberately phrased in the
  guarded shapes ("69 tools across", "65 unique"), so the next drift fails a
  test instead of shipping to npm. If you rewrite this sentence, keep those two
  phrasings intact or the number goes unchecked again.
-->

69 tools across 11 categories: 65 unique names plus 4 backwards-compat aliases (the `zpl_balance_*` pairs, which reuse another tool's handler). Every row below is a live registration, so the table adds up to the same 69.

| Category | Tools | Examples |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Core** | 10 | `zpl_compute`, `zpl_sweep`, `zpl_matrix`, `zpl_analyze`, `zpl_domains`, `zpl_health`, `zpl_plans`, `zpl_history`, `zpl_watchlist`, `zpl_report` |
| **Finance** | 7 | `zpl_market_scan`, `zpl_portfolio`, `zpl_fear_greed`, `zpl_forex_pair`, `zpl_sector_bias`, `zpl_macro`, `zpl_correlation` |
| **Gaming** | 6 | `zpl_loot_table`, `zpl_matchmaking`, `zpl_economy_check`, `zpl_pvp_balance`, `zpl_gacha_audit`, `zpl_rng_test` |
| **AI/ML** | 4 | `zpl_model_bias`, `zpl_dataset_audit`, `zpl_prompt_test`, `zpl_benchmark` |
| **Security** | 3 | `zpl_vuln_map`, `zpl_risk_score`, `zpl_compliance` |
| **Crypto** | 4 | `zpl_whale_check`, `zpl_defi_risk`, `zpl_liquidity`, `zpl_tokenomics` |
| **Certification** | 3 | `zpl_debate`, `zpl_news_bias`, `zpl_review_bias` |
| **Advanced** | 7 | `zpl_simulate`, `zpl_leaderboard`, `zpl_chart`, `zpl_teach`, `zpl_alert`, `zpl_versus` (+ alias `zpl_balance_compare`) |
| **Universal** | 8 | `zpl_check_response`, `zpl_explain`, `zpl_decide` (+ alias `zpl_balance_check`), `zpl_compare` (+ alias `zpl_balance_pair`), `zpl_rank` (+ alias `zpl_balance_rank`) |
| **Meta** | 9 | `zpl_about`, `zpl_quota`, `zpl_score_only`, `zpl_diagnose`, `zpl_validate_input`, `zpl_batch`, `zpl_export`, `zpl_usage`, `zpl_account` |
| **AI Eval** | 8 | `zpl_consistency_test`, `zpl_sycophancy_score`, `zpl_refusal_balance`, `zpl_language_equity`, `zpl_persona_drift`, `zpl_safety_boundary`, `zpl_hallucination_consistency`, `zpl_emotional_stability` |

### New in v3.2: Meta tools

| Tool | Auth | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `zpl_about` | No | Project info + doc links — works before signup |
| `zpl_quota` | Yes | Remaining tokens this month, reset date |
| `zpl_score_only` | Yes | Minimal JSON `{ain, ain_status, status, tokens}` for CI/CD pipelines — `ain` is the raw engine value (0.0-1.0), unrounded |
| `zpl_validate_input` | No | Input validation with no token cost — sanity check before paying |

### v3.0.0 Removed Tools (and why)

| Removed | Why | Replacement |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| `zpl_ask` | Accepted user-provided scores → returned "official AIN" → false authority risk | `zpl_decide`, `zpl_compare`, `zpl_rank` |
| `zpl_certify` | Generated "ZPL Certified" badge on arbitrary text → scam-tool risk | `zpl_check_response` (raw balance score, no certification claim) |
| `zpl_certificate` | Generated "Certificate ID" + grades A+/F → enabled fake ZPL endorsements | None — manual review only |
| `zpl_predict` | Name implies prediction; users misused for stock/lottery "predictions" | `zpl_chart` (historical visualization, no forecast) |
| `zpl_auto_certify` | Forced AIN badge on every Claude response → spam + false authority at scale | None — explicit user requests only |

### Quick Examples

```
> Analyze my crypto portfolio for balance: BTC 40%, ETH 25%, SOL 15%, AVAX 10%, DOT 10%

> Check if this loot table is fair: Common 60%, Uncommon 25%, Rare 10%, Legendary 5%

> Is my ML model output balanced? Class A: 1200 predictions, Class B: 300 predictions

> Check this AI response for language balance

> Compare React vs Vue across 5 criteria
```

## API Key Management

- Keys are generated at [zeropointlogic.io/dashboard/api-keys](https://zeropointlogic.io/dashboard/api-keys)
- Format: `zpl_u_` + 48 hex characters (user keys). **v3.5.0+: the MCP only accepts user keys.** Service keys (`zpl_s_...`) are engine-to-engine only — server-side, IP-restricted, not MCP-usable.
- Keys are SHA-256 hashed server-side — the plaintext is shown **once** at creation
- **To rotate a key:** create a new key, update your MCP config, restart Claude, then delete the old key
- If a key is compromised, delete it immediately from the dashboard — it's invalidated instantly

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ZPL_API_KEY` | **Yes*** | — | Your user API key (`zpl_u_...` — 48 hex chars). *Optional for `zpl_about` and `zpl_validate_input`. Format is validated client-side. Service keys (`zpl_s_...`) are rejected from v3.5.0 — they're engine-to-engine only and use IP allowlisting instead of plan limits. |
| `ZPL_MODE` | No | `pure` | `pure` hides AIN from AI on text-eval tools; `coach` exposes it. See Modes above. |
| `ZPL_ENGINE_URL` | No | `https://engine.zeropointlogic.io` | Engine base URL (must match host allowlist; see Security) |
| `ZPL_ENGINE_HOST_ALLOWLIST` | No | — | Extra allowed hostnames (comma-separated), e.g. `staging.engine.example.com` for self-hosted engines |
| `ZPL_ENGINE_ALLOW_INSECURE_LOCAL` | No | unset | Set to `1` to allow `http://` to localhost / 127.0.0.1 / ::1 **and** to treat those hostnames as allowed (no extra `ZPL_ENGINE_HOST_ALLOWLIST` needed for local dev) |
| `ZPL_ENGINE_DISABLE_URL_GUARD` | No | unset | Set to `1` to skip hostname allowlist (dangerous; mistyped URLs could exfiltrate your API key) |
| `ZPL_RATE_LIMIT` | No | `60` | Max requests per minute (applies to `zpl_compute`, `zpl_sweep`, `zpl_analyze`) |
| `ZPL_BUDGET_WARN` | No | `500` | Token budget warning threshold |
| `ZPL_MAX_RETRIES` | No | `2` | Retry count for transient engine failures (5xx only) |
| `ZPL_STORE_PATH` | No | `~/.zpl-engine/` | Local history storage path (legacy alias: `ZPL_STORE_DIR`). Must resolve inside `$HOME` or the OS tmp dir; otherwise falls back to default. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Only for AI Eval tools | — | Required for the 8 AI Eval tools (`zpl_consistency_test`, etc.). Session capped at 100 Claude calls per process. |

## Architecture

```
Your AI Client (Claude, Cursor, etc.)
    |
    v (MCP Protocol — stdio)
ZPL Engine MCP Server (this package)
    |
    +-- Tool modules (data -> engine params)
    |   +-- finance, gaming, ai-ml, security, crypto
    |   +-- certification, advanced, universal, meta
    |

```

The MCP server **never** sees or contains the engine formula. It sends `(d, bias, samples)` and receives `(ain, deviation, status)`. All computation happens server-side.

## Security

- All inputs validated via Zod schemas with strict maxLength limits
- API keys never logged or stored in plaintext locally
- **Engine URL allowlist** — requests only go to `engine.zeropointlogic.io` unless you add hosts with `ZPL_ENGINE_HOST_ALLOWLIST`. Rejects userinfo embedded in `ZPL_ENGINE_URL` (use env vars for keys). `fetch(..., { redirect: "error" })` prevents following HTTP redirects that could send your Bearer token elsewhere.
- In-memory rate limiting (configurable)
- Exponential backoff retry for transient engine failures (5xx only, not 4xx)
- Fail-fast startup if `ZPL_API_KEY` is not set (except for no-auth tools)
- Local history sanitizes API key prefixes before writing

## IP Protection (v3.0.0+)

The ZPL Engine computation method is a trade secret of Zero Point Logic. This MCP has been hardened to never expose it:

- Tool outputs return **AIN score + status + tokens used only**. No bias, deviation, p-output, dimension, or timing values are exposed.
- The MCP never receives or processes the engine formula — it sends `(d, bias, samples)` to the server and receives `(ain, status)` back.
- All computation happens server-side on the proprietary engine. The client-side code contains no algorithmic secrets.
- v3.0 removed tools that allowed user-provided scores to be presented as official AIN measurements (false authority risk).

## License

MIT (covers the MCP client code only). The ZPL Engine computation algorithm, AIN formula, and server-side processing are proprietary trade secrets of Zero Point Logic and are **NOT** covered by this license.
