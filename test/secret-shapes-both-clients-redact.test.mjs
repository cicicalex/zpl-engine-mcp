/**
 * The shapes this server must never hand back.
 *
 * AUDIT 2026-08-02. `sanitiseStatus` carried a comment saying it "mirrors the
 * regex set in mcp/src/store.ts so both clients redact the same shapes". Both
 * shipped sanitisers were run over one corpus, and the claim was false in both
 * directions:
 *
 *   short Bearer token   CLI leaked it    MCP redacted it
 *   sk_live_<...>        CLI leaked it    MCP redacted it
 *   sk_test_<...>        CLI leaked it    MCP redacted it
 *   Bearer<TAB><token>   CLI redacted it  MCP leaked it
 *
 * The `{16,}` floor on the Bearer pattern was the first of those: a short token
 * is still a token. The Stripe shapes were simply absent.
 *
 * The two lists remain two copies, because the packages ship separately and
 * neither can import the other. What holds them together is this corpus,
 * duplicated verbatim in the CLI's own suite, rather than a comment asserting
 * they match — a comment cannot notice when it stops being true.
 *
 * KEEP THIS LIST IDENTICAL to the one in the CLI repo. Adding a shape here and
 * not there is exactly the drift this replaced.
