/**
 * The method stays unpublished.
 *
 * This package is on npm. Its source, its README and its package.json
 * description are all world-readable the moment it is published, and unlike a
 * website they cannot be edited afterwards — a version that ships with the
 * derivation in it stays downloadable forever.
 *
 * AUDIT 2026-07-31: the website gained this rule today, and the first version
 * of it there used a scanner that skipped comment lines. Writing the
 * derivation into a `//` comment sailed straight past. A comment ships exactly
 * like the code around it, and it is the likeliest place for something to be
 * parked "just for now", so nothing is skipped here.
 *
 * Scanned at the time of writing: nothing in this package, the CLI, or either
 * SDK carried it. This exists so that stays true rather than being rechecked
 * by hand.
 *
 * src/ only — this file states the patterns it forbids, and a guard that
 * flags its own documentation is a guard someone deletes.
